LESSON 1: HTML Basics
What is HTML?
(HyperText Markup Language) = tool we use to create websites
HTML = giving instructions to a computer
Syntax = rules for writing code or it is a grammer (for code)
<a> = anchor element, an anchor is basically a link to another websites
HTML Attribute = modifies how an element behaves
Extra spaces are ignored (in HTML)
Extra new lines are also ignored (in HTML)
Generally in html and css we use 2 spaces per indent

LESSON 2: CSS Basics
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) = change the appearence of HTML elements
CSS Selector = which elements we are targeting
General Technique:
1. Create element with HTML
2. Style with CSS one-by-one
Space (around an element) = margin
The trick to getting the rounded buttons is we have to set the border radius to half the height or the width whichever is lower

LESSON 03: HOVERS, TRANSITIONS, SHADOWS
pseudo-class = it basically adds extra styles in a certain situation
opacity = used to fade out an element (1 to 0 => going to fade out)
transition property takes 2 values: what we want to transition, and how long this transition will take
Usually a good transition duration is somehting like 0.15s (seconds)
Make sure to put the transition property always in sort of base CSS
box-shadow takes 4 values: horizontal right , vertical down, blur, color 
Usually shadows are kind of a darker shade of whatever they are covering   
shadows are best when they are very subtle, it should not be too noticeable

LESSON 04: Chrome devTools and CSS box model
margin = first part of the box model i.e. spacing on the outside of the element
padding = second part of the box model i.e. spacing on the inside of the element
setting width and height of button is not a good idea, by default button actually adjusts the size automatically based on the content
so using padding is better alternative for height and width
CSS Box Model
- how much space an element takes up
- how far it is away from other elements
By default the browser tries to align our buttons based on the text

LESSON 05: Text styles
so website by default use the font called Times New Roman
HTML entity = lets us type out some special characters, for example 'dot' or 'checkmark'
<p> by default, come with margin at the top and bottom 
CSS Specificity = The selector that's more specific has higher priority
class name selector > element name selector
Text element = a element that is inside a line of text and then they modify that part of the text
span element is the most generic text element, it has no default styles we can style it ourselves and give it any style we want
NOTE: Block-level elements (e.g., <p>, <div>) by default respect margins and padding, creating space around them. Inline elements (e.g., <span>, <a>) do not create line breaks and do not respect top and bottom margins or padding.

LESSON 06: HTML Structure
<!DOCTYPE html> =  this line tells a browser to use modern version of html
Every file has one and only one html element and <html> = web page, this element is designed for nesting to contain one head and one body element 
So head and body elements are also designed for nesting or to have elements inside
<body> = contains all the elements that are visible on the page
<head> = contains all the elements that are not visible on the page
The really useful feature we get by following the structure is tha ability to automatically reload our page whenever we change our code using the extension 'live server'
void elements = elements that don't need a closing tag for e.g. <link> element
Filepaths: styles/buttons.css = in this filepath '/' means we are going into the styles folder
Features we get from following this HTML structure:
1. <title>  
2. Live server
3. Link CSS files
4. Add new fonts and more
